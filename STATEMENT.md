# Project Statement: Neelkantha

## Problem Statement
University students often face intense academic pressure leading to burnout. A critical, often overlooked issue is **"emotional masking,"** where students report positive numeric scores (10/10) to appear strong, even when their written reflections indicate distress. Current wellness tools fail to detect this discrepancy.

## Scope
Neelkantha is a **Gamified Behavioral Health Tracker** that addresses this by:
1.  **Gamifying Reflection:** Using the metaphor of "Prana" (energy) and evolving avatars (Candle -> Sun) to make journaling rewarding.
2.  **AI Analysis:** Using Natural Language Processing (TextBlob) to compare the user's explicit score with their implicit text sentiment to detect "Emotional Dissonance."
3.  **Intervention:** Providing immediate "Pranayama" breathing exercises when the system detects high stress or conflict.

## Target Users
* College students facing academic stress.
* Individuals seeking a mindful approach to habit tracking.
